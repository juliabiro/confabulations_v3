            Dear visitor,
        </br>
        Welcome to the Virtual Album that encompasses the storytelling of {% for p in participants %}<a href="{{p.url}}">{{p.name}}</a>{% if not forloop.last %}, {% endif %} {% endfor %} {% if last %} and <a href="{{last.url}}">{{last.name}}</a>{% endif %}.
            </br>
            From here you can access all the collected <a href="/story/">stories</a>.
        </br>
        </br>
        Above you can find a menu through which you can access stories that are confabulations and those which 'go beyond' the visual content of the photographs. There is a menu for the participants' pages, which give further information on the stories. On the left side-bar, you can see a another menu which colour-codes aspects of the stories. On the partcipants pages, there is a side-bar on the right that gives information on stories that connect with each other and in what ways. Here you can also find graphs that visualise these connections. There are separate menus for connections and graphs which synthesise information.
