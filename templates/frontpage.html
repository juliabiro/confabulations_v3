            From here you can access all the collected <a href="/story/">stories</a>.
            Above you can find a menu through which you can access stories that are confabulations and those which 'go beyond' the visual content of the photographs. There is a menu for the participants' pages, which give further information on the stories. On the left side-bar, you can see another menu which colour-codes aspects of the stories. On the participants' pages, there is a side-bar on the right that gives information on stories that connect and in what ways. Here you can also find graphs that visualise these connections. There are separate menus for connections and graphs which synthesise information.
