<h5> What is this?</h5>

This page shows the graph generated from all chains, themes and stories of {{name}}. The image is zoomable, and the individual nodes can be dragged around with your mouse.
</br>
Legend:
<ul>
    <li>Big circles represent chains <img src="{{legend.chain}}"></li>
    <li>Triangles represent themes<img src="{{legend.theme}}"></li>
    <li>Dots represent stories<img src="{{legend.story}}"></li>
    <li>Yellow edges and backgrounds indicate inter-connections <img src="{{legend.inter}}"></li>
</ul>
</br>
</br>
The page programmatically generates the graph. The arrangement of the nodes is calculated by a physical model that includes springs, gravitational forces and repulsion. It is a dynamic representation, if the position of a node changes, the other nodes rearrange themselves around it.

</br>
Please be aware that this representation is computation-heavy; consequently, it calculates on the client side, in your browser. Therefore it can make your computer slow or start the ventilation. If this happens, just navigate away.
