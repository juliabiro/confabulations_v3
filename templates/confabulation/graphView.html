This graph was programmatically generated with the help of a graph visualisation tool. The arrangement of the nodes is calculated by a physical model that includes springs, gravitational forces and repulsion. It is a dynamic representation, if the position of a node changes, the other nodes rearrange themselves around it.

Please be aware that this representation is computation-heavy and it is calulated on the client side, in your browser. Therefore it can make your computer slow or start the ventillation; if this happens, just navigate away.
